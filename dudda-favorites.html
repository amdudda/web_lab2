                <dd>One of my favorite movies is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092048/">Tampopo</a>.
                    It's often described as a "ramen western". It's a silly comedy that riffs off of the tropes of
                    Cowboy
                    Westerns,
                    while also poking fun at Japanese culture. I watch it when I need a silly laugh.

                <dt>Lilo and Stitch</dt>
                <dd>A lovely <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275847/">children's movie</a> about an orphaned girl
                    and an
                    evil alien who learn the power of chosen family.

            <P>
                My favorite musician is <strong>Tanita Tikaram</strong> (<a href="http://www.tanita-tikaram.com/">website</a>).
                She was a one-hit wonder back in the late 1980s, but has continued to produce albums at widely spaced
                intervals since then. It's hard to pick a favorite song, but two that I really love are "Wonderful
                Shadow" and "World Outside Your Window".
            </P>

                I also have delusions of being a musician. I used to play the cello, and I've taken up the tenor
                recorder. The picture below is one from Wikipedia, and it looks very annoying to play because it doesn't
                have an extension lever for low C. I would not enjoy having to stretch my little finger all the way down
                to reach that note! Mine only has a single lever for C, so I have no good way to play low C-sharp.

            <h2>Books <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-book"></span></h2>
            <p>I am a big fan of science fiction stories. Here's a few books I really enjoy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="booktitle">Cyteen</span> by C.J. Cherryh. It offers deep insight into the psychology of
                    emotional manipulation.
                </li>
                <li>The <span class="booktitle">Foreigner</span> series by C.J. Cherryh - a human diplomat navigates
                    contradictory
                    political demands while living amongst aliens whose supreme judicial arm is the Assassins' Guild.
                </li>
                <li>The <span class="booktitle">Xenogenesis</span> trilogy by Octavia Butler. Just go read her stuff;
                    it's
                    really deep
                    and looks hard at power, privilege, and oppression.
                </li>
                <li><span class="booktitle">Little Sister</span> by Kara Dalkey. This one is a short read, and fantasy
                    rather than
                    SF, but still a favorite.
                </li>
                <li>For a fun romp, I recommend anything by Seanan McGuire. I suggest starting with <span
                        class="booktitle">Rosemary and Rue</span>,
                    which is basically "changeling kicks elvin ass in San Francisco". For a sampler of her style, she
                    has
                    some
                    lovely short stories available for download at <a href="http://seananmcguire.com/">her website</a>.
                    Seanan
                    also writes horror novels under the pseudonym Mira Grant.

            <p>I also did these two other pages for my Web Programming course:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A simple bootstrap page about the <a href="dudda_bootstrap.html">Musicology Institute program</a> I wrote for my Java course in December of 2015.</li>
                <li>A <a href="dudda_simplyme.html">Simply Me</a> sample page based on a W3Schools exercise.</li>
